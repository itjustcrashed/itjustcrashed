## Who I am 😎
I'm a developer with a passion for being on the bleeding edge of things. I also like to experiment and do-things-myself. (D.I.Y.) But you may be asking, "What the hell is your name?" and to that I answer: none of your buisness, creep.

## Preferences ⚙️
- 💻 Laptops every day of the week
- 🤖 Android (Green Bubble Gang!)
- 🍝 Spagghetti, the best meal
