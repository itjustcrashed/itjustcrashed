  <h1>👋 Hello, fellow developers!</h1>
  <p>It's your friendly neighborhood linux user</p>

## Who I am 😎
I'm a developer with a passion for being on the bleeding edge of things. I also like to experiment and do-things-myself. (DIY.) And it's why I love linux! But you may be asking, "What the hell is your name?" and to that I answer: none of your buisness creep.

## Preferences ⚙️
- 💻 Laptops every day of the week
- 🤖 Android (Green bubble gang!)
- 🍝 Spagghetti, the best meal
- 🌸 Vanilla Ice-Cream

## My Opinion on FOSS 💻
I think FOSS is very great! But I'm not one of those people who won't use proprietary and non-free software. I just _prefer_ things to be FOSS. Or at least be trustworthy, and have an API for users to customize their workflow. I'll use Google Play, and whatnot. But I still like when stuff is FOSS, or even open-source. Even if it's an app that has some proprietary stuff built onto it's open core (lookin' at you _chrome_.)
